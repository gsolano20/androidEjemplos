## Why this Project?
I always wanted a place to go to when ever i wanted an example of some code that i understand but forget about it, like an adapter for a recyclerview or the code for firebase authentication, so i created this project to but all the use cases that i will ever need as an android developer, combined with best practices for codeing and project architecture and great documentation and comments.
